**My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.**

I usually follow along and post solutions the first few days of December each year, to then fall off and sporadically solve the remaining problems in the coming weeks and months.

My solutions are so far written in Python (2021, -22, -25) and TypeScript (Deno) (2023, -24).

There is no particular theme to how I solve, sometimes I go for minimal time spent on the problem (usually leads to the most naive solution that is good enough), but more often than not I go for either a "beautiful" solution (whatever that means), or try to push performance to the limit, depending on the problem.
